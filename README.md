# Zelda BotW map extractor

Extract's and rebuilds a full map of zelda BotW interactive maps (any)

Actually could probably extract any map of any size as long as their files follows the pattern "X-Y", where X and Y are sequential numbers

## How to use

You need to install [GraphicMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/) for the image stitching

Simply run `npm install` and `npm start` to run the tool

Read the first few lines (for now) to see the "parameters" you can give it (hardcoded, for now).
